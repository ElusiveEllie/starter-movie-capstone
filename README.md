# WeLoveMovies

This application exhibits a full-stack environment. The front end was provided by Chegg Skills while the back end was developed by myself. To access the client, [follow this link](https://we-love-movies-frontend-ccdn.onrender.com/). 

The application accesses a hosted PostgreSQL database for the backend which returns listings of movies, movie theaters, and reviews. The main page shows lists of movies, with a possible query to filter only to movies that are currently showing or to show all movies. The `All Movies` page lists each movie alongside a thumbnail, a description, and more information. Each individual movie also has a page, where theaters showing the movie are listed and various reviews are displayed. The `All Theaters` page lists each theater alongside thumbnails of each movie that link to the individual movie page again.

The database is hosted on ElephantSQL under the free tier and may only allow 5 concurrent connections. The back end and front end are both hosted on Render.
